Airways can also become inflamed and produce more mucus than normal. These changes in the airways cause symptoms such as difficulty breathing, coughing, and wheezing.

It is characterized by degeneration of articular cartilage and other joint changes, and it commonly presents as joint pain with ambulation or other activities of daily living, depending on the joint(s) affected. According to the analysis of data from 3 large US population‐based studies, it is estimated that almost 27 million Americans 25 years of age and older suffer from clinical OA, a number that has increased from estimates in the 1990s.6 Prevalence is much higher in women, as females comprise approximately 78% of adults with OA.7 Prevalence also increases with age; 43% of adults over the age of 65 years have OA. This age group is expected to increase from 15% of the US population to 24% in the next 40 years.8 It should be noted that exact figures for incidence and prevalence are difficult to obtain due to differences in study designs and definitions of OA.\r",{"entities":[[0,14,"MEDICAL CONDITION"],[16,18,"MEDICAL CONDITION"],[211,221,"SYMPTOMS"],[227,237,"SYMPTOMS"]]}],["Cholesterol can be measured in the blood. There are 2 different types of cholesterol: low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). To simplify things, we think of LDL as “bad” and HDL as “good.” Too much LDL causes a fatty build-up in your arteries (also known as plaque), increasing the risk of heart attack, stroke, and other diseases. HDL can help remove some of the LDL by transporting it back to your liver, which then removes it from your body.\r",{"entities":[]}],["People with hyperhidrosis tend to sweat heavily, even at rest, and this can interfere with normal activities. For example, sweaty hands can make simple activities like writing or turning a doorknob difficult. Hyperhidrosis can also put you at greater risk for skin infections, like athlete’s foot. Unsurprisingly, all of this often negatively impacts the quality of life. Many people with hyperhidrosis report that it leads to negative emotions, lack of self-confidence, and social anxiety.\r",{"entities":[[12,25,"MEDICAL CONDITION"],[209,222,"MEDICAL CONDITION"],[389,402,"MEDICAL CONDITION"],[475,489,"MEDICAL CONDITION"]]}],["Infection from Listeria can occur in any trimester of pregnancy. It can cause mild or serious illness in a pregnant woman, but it can also pass from mother to baby. That means it can harm the unborn baby, causing serious infections like sepsis and meningitis. It can also cause permanent damage to a baby’s vital organs, like the brain and heart. Listeria infection can also result in preterm (early) labor, miscarriage, and stillbirth.
